**Agile Budget Tracker with Investment Forecasting
**This project is a web-based dashboard designed to bridge the gap between Agile project management and financial accountability. It moves beyond tracking velocity and story points to quantify the real financial performance of development sprints by calculating cost, business value, and return on investment (ROI).

Core Problem Solved:

This tool addresses key pain points for modern software teams:
- Lack of ROI Visibility: Companies spend heavily on development without a clear view of the financial ROI per sprint.
- Budget Justification: Project managers struggle to justify team budgets to executives in measurable financial terms.
- Siloed Data: Agile data (in Jira/Trello) and financial data (in spreadsheets) are disconnected, making analysis difficult.

This platform connects these two worlds, turning Agile data into financial insights.


Technology Used:

- Frontend | React.js, Plotly.js (for charts) 
- Backend | Django REST Framework (Python) 
- Database | PostgreSQL
